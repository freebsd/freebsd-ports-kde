qtchooser is a wrapper that allows to specify Qt version of binaries for
qmake, moc and other tools will be run when invoking the binaries in $PATH.

By default, the Qt5 versions are run. It is possible to change the behavior by
setting the QT_SELECT environment variable to "qtX", where X is desired Qt
version, provided that it is offered by the Ports Collection. See qtchooser(1)
for more information.
