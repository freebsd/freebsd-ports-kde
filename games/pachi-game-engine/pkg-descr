Pachi can refer to: a simple modular framework for programs playing the game
of Go/Weiqi/Baduk, and a reasonably strong engine built within this framework.

The default engine plays by Chinese rules and should be about 7d KGS strength on
9x9. On 19x19, it can hold a KGS 2d rank on modest hardware (Raspberry Pi, dcnn)
or faster machine (e.g. six-way Intel i7) without dcnn. When using a large
cluster (64 machines, 20 cores each), it maintains KGS 4d and has won e.g. a
7-stone handicap game against Zhou Junxun 9p.
