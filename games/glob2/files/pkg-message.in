Globulation 2 has been installed.

You can try to launch it typing

    glob2

Anyway, it will not always work, so it is suggested that you type

    glob2 --help

and read about command lines arguments.

Try to use -G option if you have problems with dri and glx (OpenGL),
or -m if you have problems with sound, or -C to disable custom cursor.
