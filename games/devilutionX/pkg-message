This game requires a datafile from the original Diablo(tm) CD or the GOG release.
If you don't own it yet, you can buy it at https://www.gog.com/game/diablo

Copy DIABDAT.MPQ to ~/.local/share/diasurgical/devilution/diabdat.mpq
Pay attention to the case, the resulting file needs to be entirely lowercase!

If you have any issues with this game, file a bug report on the GitHub page:
https://github.com/diasurgical/devilutionX/issues

Note that only 32-bit builds are currently supported, amd64 is experimental but
seems to be working fine as far as I've tested.
