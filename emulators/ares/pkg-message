Users are encouraged to compile the port on their systems with

    CFLAGS   ?= -O3
    CPUTYPE  ?= native | ... | x86-64-v3 | ... | skylake | ...
    WITH_LTO =  yes

This can improve the performance of demanding cores like the N64.

NVIDIA GPU users with versions >= 535 of the x11/nvidia-driver could encounter
crashes or freezes while using the N64 core, see
https://github.com/ares-emulator/ares/issues/1547 and
https://github.com/Themaister/Granite/issues/133. As a workaround either try to
compile the port with the NVIDIA option set (recommended), or disable the NVIDIA
shader disk cache at startup with

    $ __GL_SHADER_DISK_CACHE=0 ares

The port provides the HOTKEYS option. This applies an inofficial patch which
locks all hotkey execution in the unpaused state of the emulator. This can be a
convenience for gamepad-only users who want to assign hotkey actions to gamepad
buttons but who don't have enough free unassigned buttons left on the gamepad.

The port uses the shaders from games/libretro-shaders-slang by default. Users
can curate and utilize their own provided collection of shaders by putting them
into the user data directory

    ${HOME}/.local/share/ares/Shaders/

ares won't process its own installed shaders if it finds any shaders in the user
data directory. Delete or rename the local shaders directory in order to make
ares use its own shaders again.
