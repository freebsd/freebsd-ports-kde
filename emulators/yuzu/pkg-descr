yuzu is an experimental open-source emulator for the Nintendo Switch
from the creators of Citra.

It is written in C++ with portability in mind, with builds actively
maintained for Windows, Linux and macOS. The emulator is currently
only useful for homebrew development and research purposes.

yuzu only emulates a subset of Switch hardware and therefore is
generally only useful for running/debugging homebrew
applications. yuzu can boot some games, to varying degrees of success.
