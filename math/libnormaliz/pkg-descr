Normaliz is an open source tool for computations in affine monoids,
vector configurations, lattice polytopes, and rational cones.

Computation goals:
- convex hulls and dual cones;
- conversion from generators to constraints and vice versa;
- projections of cones and polyhedra;
- triangulations, disjoint decompositions and Stanley decompositions;
- Hilbert basis of rational, not necessarily pointed cones;
- normalization of affine monoids;
- lattice points of rational polytopes and (unbounded) polyhedra;
- Euclidean and lattice normalized volumes of polytopes;
- Hilbert (or Ehrhart) series and (quasi) polynomials under Z-gradings
(for example, for rational polytopes);
- generalized (or weighted) Ehrhart series and Lebesgue integrals of
polynomials over rational polytopes.
