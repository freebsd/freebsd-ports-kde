If you are installing Frobby as a dependency, most probably you only
need the static library and maybe the shared library, but certainly
not the executable.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Warning: the library documentation is very incomplete.
Warning: installing documentation might require high build times due
to heavy build dependencies.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Warning: hilbert_deform and hilbert_bigatti tests are known to fail
because simplifications do not work for action "hilbert" with
algorithm "deform" or "bigatti", i.e. output polynomials present
expressions such as "a*b*c + a*b*c" or "a - a". Nevertheless results
seem to be correct.
Please report if you get wrong results.
