Mandelbulber creatively generates three-dimensional fractals.
Explore trigonometric, hyper-complex, Mandelbox, IFS, and many other
3D fractals.

Render with a great palette of customizable materials to create stunning images
and videos.

Features:
* Enlightening Documentation

  fractals
* Complex 3D ray-marching: hard shadows, ambient occlusion, depth of field,
  translucency & refraction, etc.
* Rich GUI in Qt 5 environment
* Unlimited image resolution on 64-bit systems
* Program compiled for x86 and x64 CPUs (Linux, Windows, OSX)
* Simple 3D navigator
* Distributed Network Rendering
* Rendering using OpenCL
* Key-frame animation for all parameters with different interpolations
