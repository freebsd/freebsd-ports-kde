OpenKIM is an online framework for making molecular simulations reliable,
reproducible, and portable. Computer implementations of interatomic models are
archived in OpenKIM, verified for coding integrity, and tested by computing
their predictions for a variety of material properties. Models conforming to the
KIM application programming interface (API) work seamlessly with major
simulation codes that have adopted the KIM API standard.
