This port provides both serial and parallel (MPI) binaries.  Use of
the MPI binary is strongly recommended on any machine with multiple
cores available.  The serial binary is provided only for testing and
very small models.

To run a model on a workstation using 4 cores, use:

	mpirun -n 4 dlpoly-classic-mpi

To run on a cluster, please see the documentation for your scheduler software.
