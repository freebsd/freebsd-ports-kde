Zope Successfull installed.

To create an instance of Zope using the default location, please run:

%%LOCALBASE%%/bin/mkzopeinstance --dir %%ZOPEINSTANCEDIR%%
chown %%ZOPE_USER%%:%%ZOPE_USER%% %%ZOPEINSTANCEDIR%%var
chown %%ZOPE_USER%%:%%ZOPE_USER%% %%ZOPEINSTANCEDIR%%log

Command-line options to 'mkzopeinstance' are available, and can be
investigated by running 'mkzopeinstance --help'.

Zope instances, created by mkzopeinstance, will not be removed
when the package is deinstalled. You'll have to delete them yourself.

If you are not using the default instance location, please use the
desired paths during creation and add this line to /etc/rc.conf:

zope213_instances="<INSTANCEDIR>"

Additional Zope instances have to be added to zope213_instances
separated by a space.

If Zope should get started automatically when the system starts,
please add the following line to /etc/rc.conf:

zope213_enable="YES"
EOM
