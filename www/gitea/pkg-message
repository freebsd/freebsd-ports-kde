When upgrading from Gitea 1.7 or earlier, Gitea requires the addition of
another secret to the config file in order to start up.  Either manually add
JWT_SECRET to the ${PREFIX}/etc/gitea/conf/app.ini config file (see
app.ini.sample), or allow Gitea to make the change for you by making the
config file writable to the git user.
