To switch to the newer QtWebEngine web backend, add this section to the
~/.config/otter/otter.conf:

[Backends]
Web=qtwebengine

If you get wrong colors when watching videos while using the QtWebEngine
backend, this is probably because your system does not support hardware
acceleration (see bug 237277): you can disable it by starting the browser
from command line with the --disable-gpu option.
