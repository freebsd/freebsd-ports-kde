FMD ("Find My Device") web server written in Go
Privacy-preserving mobile device location

FMD allows you to locate and remotely control your Android device.
This is useful if you have lost or misplaced it. FMD is decentralised, and
users remain in full control of their data.

With FMD, you can send commands to your phone: to locate it via GPS, to locate
it via nearby cell towers, to take a picture, to lock it, to let it ring, or to
factory-reset it. Commands can be sent over multiple transport channels: over
SMS, over third-party messaging apps like Signal or Matrix (that post
a notification to the Android notification tray), or over the "FMD Server"
(a self-hostable server providing a web interface to control your device).

For full self-hosted mode, use toghether with sysutils/go-ntfy
