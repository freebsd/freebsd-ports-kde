1 Add the following to your Apache configuration, and
   restart the server:

   ### Add the AcceptPathInfo directive only for Apache 2.0.30 or later.
   Alias /efront %%WWWDIR%%
   AcceptPathInfo On
   <Directory %%WWWDIR%%>
      AllowOverride None
      Order Allow,Deny
      Allow from all
   </Directory>

3) Visit your eFront site with a browser (i.e.,
   http://your.server.com/efront/), and you should
   be taken to the install.php script, which will lead
   you through creating a config file and then
   setting up eFront, creating an admin account, etc.
