To use the TracGantt plugin, please follow these instructions:

Edit your Trac config file to add custom fields to tickets, as well
as set the expected date format of those fields.

The first things to add are the new ticket fields. If you already
have a ticket-custom section, append these to it:

	[ticket-custom]
	due_assign = text
	due_assign.label = Due to assign
	due_assign.value = DD/MM/YYYY

	dependencies = text
	dependencies.label = Dependencies
	dependencies.value =
	due_close= text

	due_close.label = Due to close
	due_close.value = DD/MM/YYYY

	include_gantt = checkbox
	include_gantt.label = Include in GanttChart
	include_gantt.value =

This will add four new fields to tickets, a "Due to assign" field,
which contains the date by which this ticket should be assigned, a
"Dependencies" field, for listing ticket numbers upon which this
ticket depends, a "Due to close" field, which contains the date by
which this ticket should be closed, and finally a checkbox that
allows the ticket to be included in Gantt charts.

In addition, TracGantt provides several tweakable configuration
knobs that you can use to change the behavior of the gantt charts.
They are listed below with their default values.

	[gantt-charts]

	# The format of dates entered by humans in the above ticket
	# fields
	date_format = %m/%d/%Y

	# Include the ticket summary in the gantt chart display
	include_summary = true

	# Trim the included summary to the given number of characters
	summary_length = 16

	# Use the creation date of a ticket as the "due assign"
	# date if no assignment date is given
	use_creation_date = true

	# Show on the gantt chart the date the ticket was opened,
	# to contrast with the assignment date.
	show_opened = true


NOTE: If you are placing the module anywhere outside of Trac's
standard 'plugins' directory (i.e. to share across Trac instances),
then you will also need to add:

	[components]
	tracgantt.* = enabled

to your Trac config file. Again, this is only necessary if the egg
file is placed outside of the Trac 'plugins' folder, in a standard
Python search path.

If you are using Trac with Apache and mod_python, you may also need
to restart Apache, to avoid the plugin being accessible from one
Apache process, but not others.
