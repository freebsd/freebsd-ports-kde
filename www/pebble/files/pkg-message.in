Pebble will store its data files in:

  %%PEBBLE_HOME%%

You may change this location as well as set other useful configuration settings
(e.g blog URL, enable multi-blogs) by editing the following file:

  %%PEBBLE_PROPERTIES%%

Should you upgrade this package, your configuration settings will not be
overwritten. Rather, a sample configuration file will be provided:

  %%PEBBLE_PROPERTIES%%.sample

To setup your blog, read the documentation at:
