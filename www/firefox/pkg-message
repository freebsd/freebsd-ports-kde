- Crash Reporter (requires Google Breakpad and reproducible builds)
- Performance profiling (requires GeckoProfiler)
- Gamepad API (requires libusbhid backend)
- WebVR (requires open source runtime)
- TCP fast open

On FreeBSD < 11.3 Web Content process may frequently crash due to bug 181741.
If you cannot upgrade try applying the following workaround:

$ sysctl net.local.stream.recvspace=16384



To select non-default audio backend open about:config page and create
media.cubeb.backend preference. Supported values are: alsa, jack,
pulse, pulse-rust, sndio. Currently used backend can be inspected

smb:// issues (Gvfs/GIO option):
Network group, machine, and share browsing does not work correctly.

sftp:// (Gvfs/GIO option):
Only sftp access using public key authentication works.  To easily
setup public key authentication to "remote_host":

ssh-keygen
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_host "cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys"

The SSH server on remote_host must allow pub key authentication.
