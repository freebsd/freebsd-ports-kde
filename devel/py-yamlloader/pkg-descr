This module provides loaders and dumpers for PyYAML.

Currently, an OrderedDict loader/dumper is implemented, allowing to keep items
order when loading respective dumping a file from/to an OrderedDict.

(Python 3.8+: Also regular dicts are supported and are the default items to be
loaded to.  As of Python 3.7 preservation of insertion order is a language
feature of regular dicts.)

This project was originally mirrored from "yamlordereddict" and contains
several improvements including automated testing and the much faster C-versions
of the Loaders/Dumpers.
