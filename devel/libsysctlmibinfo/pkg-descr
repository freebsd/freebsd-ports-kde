sysctlmibinfo is an open source library for FreeBSD:

 * provides a C API to wrap kern_sysctl.c undocumented interface
 * defines and builds a handy mib-object
 * builds object-list and object-tree in userspace

The advantages to use sysctlmibinfo are:

 * an easy userspace API to the kernel sysctl mib-tree
 * building quickly a custom sysctl(8) tool
 * changes to kern_sysctl.c interface won't upset userspace tools
