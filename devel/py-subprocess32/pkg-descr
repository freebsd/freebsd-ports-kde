This is a backport of the Python 3 subprocess module for use on Python 2. This
code has not been tested on Windows or other non-POSIX platforms.

subprocess32 includes many important reliability bug fixes relevant on POSIX
platforms. The most important of which is a C extension module used internally
to handle the code path between fork() and exec(). This module is reliable when
an application is using threads.
