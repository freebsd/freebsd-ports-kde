This is an implementation of an ordered dictionary for Python, in C, with Key
Insertion Order (KIO: updates of values do not affect the position of the key),
Key Value Insertion Order (KVIO, an existing key's position is removed and put
at the back).

Sorted dictionaries are also provided. Currently only with Key Sorted Order
(KSO, no sorting function can be specified, but you can specify a transform to
apply on the key before comparison (e.g. string.lower)).

The functionality is equivalent to the excellent pure-Python Larosa/Foord
implementation of ordereddict. It is a superset of the collections.OrderedDict
in the standard library (which was added a few years after this ordereddict was
orginally implemented).
