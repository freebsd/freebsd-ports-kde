This is an implementation of PEP 557, Data Classes. It is a backport for
Python 3.6. Because dataclasses will be included in Python 3.7, any discussion
of dataclass features should occur on the python-dev mailing list at
https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev. At this point this repo
should only be used for historical purposes (it's where the original dataclasses
discussions took place) and for discussion of the actual backport to Python 3.6.
