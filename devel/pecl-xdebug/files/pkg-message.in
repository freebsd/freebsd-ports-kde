The php debugger 'xdebug' has been installed successful.
Add a line containing

	extension=%%PREFIX%%/lib/php/%%PHP_EXT_DIR%%/xdebug.so

or

	zend_extension=%%PREFIX%%/lib/php/%%PHP_EXT_DIR%%/xdebug.so

to your php.ini to load it. xdebug is not compatible with the extension
'Zend Optimizer' - you're only able to use one of them. So take care having
at least the lesser required extension disabled by commenting out it's
loader line in your php.ini.

Add following section to enable profiling:

xdebug.profiler_enable = 1
xdebug.profiler_output_dir = /tmp/profiler
