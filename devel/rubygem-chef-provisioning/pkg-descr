Chef Provisioning is a Cookbook and Recipe based approach for managing your
infrastructure. Users can codify their infrastructure and use Chef to converge
their infrastructure to the desired state. It has a plugin model (called
Drivers) to manage different infrastructures, including AWS, Azure and Fog.
