pythondialog 3 is a Python 3 wrapper for the dialog utility originally
written by Savio Lam, and later rewritten by Thomas E. Dickey.  Its purpose
is to provide an easy to use, pythonic and comprehensive Python 3 interface
to dialog.  This allows one to make simple text-mode user interfaces on
Unix-like systems.
