BoringTun is an implementation of the WireGuard protocol designed for
portability and speed.

The project consists of two parts:

* The executable boringtun, a userspace WireGuard implementation for
  Linux and macOS.
* The library boringtun that can be used to implement fast and efficient
  WireGuard client apps on various platforms, including iOS and Android.
  It implements the underlying WireGuard protocol, without the network
  or tunnel stacks, those can be implemented in a platform idiomatic way.

NOTE: This crate is still undergoing review for security concerns.
Therefore, we recommend that you take caution before using it in a
production application.
