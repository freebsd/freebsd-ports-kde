The TURN Server is a VoIP media traffic NAT traversal server and gateway. It can
be used as a general-purpose network traffic TURN server and gateway, too.

On-line management interface (over telnet or over HTTPS) for the TURN server is
available.

The implementation also includes some extra experimental features.
