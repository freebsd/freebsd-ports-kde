This tool computes (dis)similarity between two or more PNG images
using an algorithm approximating human vision.

Comparison is done in L*a*b* color space (D65 white point, sRGB gamma)
using a multi-scale variant of the SSIM algorithm.

Features:
- Supports alpha channel
- Supports gamma correction
- No OpenCV or MATLAB needed: uses safe Rust without external dependencies
