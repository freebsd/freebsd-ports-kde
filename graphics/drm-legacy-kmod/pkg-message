The drm-legacy-kmod port can be enabled for older Intel and ATI/AMD graphics
adapters as well as legacy graphics adapters through kld_list in /etc/rc.conf.

Simply add kld_list="/boot/modules/[driver].ko to /etc/rc.conf, for example
kld_list="/boot/modules/i915kms.ko" for the intel GPU driver or
kld_list="/boot/modules/radeonkms.ko" for the ATI/AMD GPU driver.

Please ensure that all users requiring graphics are members of the
"video" group.

If you are having trouble with ATI/AMD graphics cards and X, try installing
xf86-video-ati-legacy instead of xf86-video-ati.
