The JPEG XL Image Coding System (ISO/IEC 18181) has a rich feature set
and is particularly optimised for responsive web environments, so that
content renders well on a wide range of devices. Moreover, it includes
several features that help transition from the legacy JPEG format.

WARNING: Until further notice, do not depend on future decoders being
         able to decode the output of a current encoder.
