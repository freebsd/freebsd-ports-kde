 Please read the README file before running "scamp.sh"
 If updating from a version earlier than 5.2j, it is suggested
 that you first run: "scamp.sh -D" to delete all old configurations.
 Then, running "scamp.sh" will cause the script to create a new
 configuration file.

 Check the "README" or "man scamp" for further information.

 The new versions of "scamp" can download definition files not
 previously available in the older versions.

 You will also have to recreate any other additional configuration
 files you might have used previously.

 I apologize for this inconvenience; however, it is the only feasible
 way to insure that you have the most up-to-date configuration.

 You will need to manually create any additional configuration files.
 Read the README or type "man scamp" for further assistance.

 To completely remove "scamp" from your system, delete the config
 directory -- usually "/usr/local/etc/scamp"
