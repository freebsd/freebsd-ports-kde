The Hidden Lake is an anonymous network built on a micro-service
architecture. At the heart of HL is the core - HLS (service), which generates
anonymizing traffic and combines many other services (for example, HLF and
HLM). Thus, Hidden Lake is not a whole and monolithic solution, but a
composition of several combined services. The HL is a friend-to-friend (F2F)
network, which means building trusted communications. Due to this approach,
members of the HL network can avoid spam in their direction, as well as possible
attacks if vulnerabilities are found in the code.
