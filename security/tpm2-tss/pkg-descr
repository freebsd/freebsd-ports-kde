OSS implementation of the TCG TPM2 Software Stack (TSS2)
* libtss2-esys - Enhanced System API (ESAPI) as described in the TSS 2.0
  Enhanced System API   (ESAPI) Specification.
  This API is a 1-to-1 mapping of the TPM2 commands documented in Part 3
  of the TPM2 specification. Additionally there are asynchronous versions
  of each command. In addition to SAPI, the ESAPI performs tracking of meta
  data for TPM object and automatic calculation of session authorization and
  parameters encryption.

* libtss2-sys - System API (SAPI) as described in the system level API and TPM
  command transmission interface specification. This API is a 1-to-1 mapping of
  the TPM2 commands documented in Part 3 of the TPM2 specification.
  Additionally there are asynchronous versions of each command.

* libtss2-mu - Marshaling/Unmarshaling (MU) as described in the TCG TSS 2.0
  Marshaling/Unmarshaling API Specification. This API provides a set of
  marshaling and unmarshaling functions for all data types define by the TPM
  library specification.

* TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) that is described in the same
  specification. This API provides a standard interface to transmit/receive
  TPM command/response buffers.
