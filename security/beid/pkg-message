WARNING:
The private keys on the eID cards are created by the Belgian government and
not by the citizens.  You should assume that the government can forge digital
signatures and decrypt encrypted content.

The procfs file system must be mounted on /proc for the PKCS #11 module to
work.  Add the following line to /etc/fstab and run "mount procfs".

procfs		/proc		procfs	rw		0	0

Make sure you have installed a pcsc-lite driver for your card reader (such
as devel/libccid) and that pcscd is running (add pcscd_enable="YES" to
/etc/rc.conf and start the service by running "service pcscd start").

To use your eID in Firefox you have to enable the "eID Belgium" extension
in the Add-ons Manager.
