Video converter reading from DVD and Bluray

MakeMKV is your one-click solution to convert video that you own into free and
patents-unencumbered format that can be played everywhere. MakeMKV is a format
converter, otherwise called "transcoder". It converts the video clips from
proprietary (and usually encrypted) disc into a set of MKV files, preserving
most information but not changing it in any way. The MKV format can store
multiple video/audio tracks with all meta-information and preserve chapters.
There are many players that can play MKV files nearly on all platforms, and
there are tools to convert MKV files to many formats, including DVD and Blu-ray
discs.

* Reads DVD and Blu-ray discs
* Reads Blu-ray discs protected with latest versions of AACS and BD+
* Preserves all video and audio tracks, including HD audio
* Preserves chapters information
* Preserves all meta-information (track language, audio type)
* Fast conversion - converts as fast as your drive can read data.
* No additional software is required for conversion or decryption.
* Functionality to open DVD discs is free and will always stay free.
* All features (including Blu-ray decryption and processing) are free during
  BETA.

Known issues on FreeBSD:

* Only the commandline interface works, so there is no GUI in this port. The
  port includes a small manpage to get you started using makemkvcon.
* makemkvcon always crashes on exit (after completing its job), so be aware
  this might leave core files on your system.
* To find optical drives, makemkvcon uses some entries from Linux' sysfs that
  aren't present on FreeBSD. A script `update-makemkv-drives` is included with
  the port that fakes these entries. It is run automatically on installation,
  but if the system's configuration changes, it must be run manually again by
  root.

Requirements:

* A custom FreeBSD kernel with sg devices (Linux' "scsi generic" interface) is
  required to use makemkvcon. To build such a kernel, add "device sg" to your
  kernel configuration and follow the instructions at
  https://www.freebsd.org/doc/handbook/kernelconfig-building.html
* Make sure you have the "linux" kernel module loaded. On amd64, "linux64" is
  also required.
