+        
+        [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/webcomics/dosage.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/webcomics/dosage)
+        [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/webcomics/dosage/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/webcomics/dosage)
+        [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/webcomics/dosage/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/webcomics/dosage)
+        [![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/maintenance/yes/2018.svg)]()
+        
+        Dosage is designed to keep a local copy of specific webcomics and other
+        picture-based content such as Picture of the Day sites. With the dosage
+        commandline script you can get the latest strip of a webcomic, or catch-up to
+        the last strip downloaded, or download a strip for a particular date/index (if
+        the webcomic's site layout allows this).
+        
+        Multiple webcomics can be downloaded in parallel, making the update of comic
+        strips faster.
+        
+        ## Notice
+        
+        This software is in no way intended to publically "broadcast" comic strips, it
+        is purely for personal use. Please be aware that by making downloaded strips
+        publically available (without the explicit permission of the author) you may be
+        infringing upon various copyrights.
+        
+        Additionally, Dosage respects the robots.txt exclusion protocol. This makes
+        sure no content is accessed in an automatic way without consent by the
+        publishers.
+        
+        In any case, you should support the authors of the comics you are downloading,
+        either by buying some of their products or even donating them some money since
+        they provide the comics you like and read.
+        
+        If you are a publisher of comics and want Dosage to access your files,
+        add the following entry to your robots.txt file:
+        
+            User-agent: Dosage
+            Allow: *
+        
+        ## Adult content
+        
+        Some comics contain adult content and require age confirmation. These comics
+        can only be downloaded by using the `--adult` option, which confirms that you
+        are old enough to view them.
+        
+        ## Usage
+        
+        List available comics (ca. 3000 at the moment):
+        
+            $ dosage --list
+        
+        Get the latest comic of for example CalvinAndHobbes and save it in the "Comics"
+        directory:
+        
+            $ dosage CalvinAndHobbes
+        
+        If you already have downloaded several comics and want to get the latest strip
+        of all of them:
+        
+            $ dosage @
+        
+        
+        To help others find good comics, you can vote for your favourite ones:
+        
+            $ dosage --vote @
+        
+        For advanced options and features execute `dosage --help`.
+        
+        ## Dependencies
+        
+        [Python](http://www.python.org/): for Python 2.x at least 2.7.0, for Python 3.x
+        at least Python 3.3. Dosage requires the following Python modules:
+        
+        - colorama
+        - lxml
+        - pbr
+        - requests
+        - six
+        
+        For certain modules, you need the `cssselect` module, for bash argument
+        completion you need the `argcomplete` module.
+        
+        ## Installation
+        
+        The easy way with pip:
+        
+            pip install --user dosage
+        
+        You can invoke Dosage directly from the source code as `./dosage`.
+        Alternatively, you can install Dosage using setuptools by invoking `setup.py`
+        in the root of the distribution. For example:
+        
+            python setup.py install
+        
+        or if you do not have root permissions:
+        
+            python setup.py install --home=$HOME
+        
+        ## Reporting Bugs
+        
+        You can report bugs, patches or requests at the [GitHub issue
+        tracker](https://github.com/webcomics/dosage/issues) - Dosage currently
+        supports a large number of comics and that number grows on a regular basis. If
+        you feel that there are comics that Dosage does not currently support, but
+        should support, please feel free to request them.
+        
+        ## Extending Dosage
+        
+        In order to add a new webcomic, a new module class has to be created in one of
+        the *.py files in the `dosagelib/plugins` subdirectory. Look at the
+        [documentation for adding modules](doc/adding_new_comics.md) and at
+        existing module classes for examples.
+        
+        ### Test suite status
+        
+        Dosage has extensive unit tests to ensure the code quality.
+        [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) is used for continuous build and test
+        integration. See the badges at the top of this page for the current status.
