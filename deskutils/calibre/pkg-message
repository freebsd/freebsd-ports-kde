NOTE: Calibre requires Hal to be running for access to devices.  The user who
is running Calibre also needs to be able to mount devices.  For non-root users,
this means modifying %%PREFIX%%/etc/PolicyKit/PolicyKit.conf and adding the
policy there.

To allow a single user named "example" to mount removable devices, add the
following:

  <match action="org.freedesktop.hal.storage.mount-removable">
    <match user="example">
      <return result="yes" />
    </match>
  </match>

Additional users will each need their own <match user="user"> block with a
"yes" return result.

To permit all accounts to mount removable devices (allowing a denial of access
attack) add the following:

  <match action="org.freedesktop.hal.storage.mount-removable">
    <return result="yes" />
  </match>

---

In addition to the above, for USB and MTP devices the user needs
to be able to access the device node in /dev.

to be aware of USB devices attached to the machine, the user needs
to be a member of the operator group:

# pw groupmod operator -m yourusername

Then, add the following to /etc/devfs.rules, or create this file
if it does not exist yet:

[system=10]
add path 'usb/*' mode 0660 group operator

To load these new rules, add the following to /etc/rc.conf:

devfs_system_ruleset="system"

Then, restart devfs

# service devfs restart

If you are using an Android device as your e-book reader, please note
that the stock Google Books app uses a storage format that is not
supported by calibre.  The calibre FAQ recommends that either of the
free apps Aldiko or WordPlayer are used instead.

A basic startup script for calibre-server has been installed.

It can be customized and configured using the flags described in the
headers of the startup script.

The command line options are documented here:
