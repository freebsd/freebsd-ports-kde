You installed ArangoDB: a distributed NoSQL database.

To enable the service at startup, you should execute the command:
sysrc arangod_enable="YES"

To start it as a service, you should execute the command:
# service arangod start

ArangoDB starts with the empty root password.

To change the root password, run 'arangosh' as root, and execute:
require("@arangodb/users").update("root", "new-secretpassword", true);

ArangoDB has a web interface available at:
http://localhost:8529

The web interface allows you to add users, create databases, manipulate
data.

ArangoDB uses the AQL language to query and modify data, as opposed to
the SQL language used by relational databases.
