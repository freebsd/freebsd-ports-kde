If this is the first time you are installing %%PORTNAME%%, you will need
to add a default administrator, and initialise the database node.

For a single node setup, append an inital administrator username and
password to the [admins] section of your local.ini, and a [log] section:

[admins]
admin = passwd
[log]
# http://docs.couchdb.org/en/latest/config/logging.html
level = err
include_sasl = true
writer = syslog
syslog_host = localhost

Amend %%ETCDIR%%/vm.args as required, at least altering the cookie.

Then, start Apache CouchDB, and run the following commands once the
database is started for the first time, amending admin:passwd to match
your choice above to initialise the default databases:

sudo service %%PORTNAME%% start

curl -X PUT http://admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_users
curl -X PUT http://admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_replicator
curl -X PUT http://admin:passwd@127.0.0.1:5984/_global_changes

Then use the admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:5984/_utils/# as usual.
