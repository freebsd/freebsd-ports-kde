Qt is a cross-platform application and UI framework for developers
using C++ or QML, a CSS/JavaScript-like language.

Provides lightweight QML types for creating performant user interfaces for
desktop, embedded, and mobile devices. These types employ a simple styling
architecture and are very efficient.
