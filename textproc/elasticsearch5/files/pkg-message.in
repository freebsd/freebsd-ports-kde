Please see %%ETCDIR%% for sample versions of
elasticsearch.yml and logging.yml.

ElasticSearch requires memory locking of large amounts of RAM.
You will either need to set:

sysrc elasticsearch_login_class="root"

or

sysctl security.bsd.unprivileged_mlock=1

to prevent the process from failing the bootstrap.

Do note that you need to set

bootstrap.system_call_filter: false

in your elasticsearch.yml file to successfully bootstrap on non-Linux
OSes now.
