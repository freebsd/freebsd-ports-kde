You installed Faust: the programming language for realtime audio
signal processing.

In order to try it, you can put the final program from
http://faust.grame.fr/examples/2015/09/30/oscillator.html into the
source file sine.dsp, and run the faust compiler that will create
Qt UI with Jack audio backend:

$ faust2jaqt sine.dsp
$ ./sine;

It will create the window with sliders for two tunable oscillators.
