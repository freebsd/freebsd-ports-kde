Portfmt is a collection of tools for editing, formatting, and linting
FreeBSD Ports Collection Makefiles.

It comes with several tools:

- portfmt formats Makefiles
- portclippy is a linter that checks if variables are in the correct
  order in a more comprehensive way than portlint
- portedit edits Makefiles.  At the moment it only comes with a
  bump-revision command
