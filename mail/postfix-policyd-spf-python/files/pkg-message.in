# To configure Postfix
#

This package must be integrated with Postfix to be effective:

 1. Add to your postfix master.cf:

        policyd-spf  unix  -       n       n       -       0       spawn
            user=nobody argv=%%PREFIX%%/bin/policyd-spf

 2. Configure the Postfix policy service in your main.cf so that the
    "smtpd_recipient_restrictions" includes a call to the policyd-spf policy
    filter.  If you already have a "smtpd_recipient_restrictions" line, you can
    add the "check_policy_service" command anywhere *after* the line which
    reads "reject_unauth_destination" (otherwise you're system can become an
    open relay).

        smtpd_recipient_restrictions =
            ...
            reject_unauth_destination
            check_policy_service unix:private/policyd-spf
            ...

        policyd-spf_time_limit = 3600

  3. Please consult the postfix documentation for more information on these and
     other settings you may wish to have in the "smtpd_recipient_restrictions"
     configuration.

  4. Reload postfix.
