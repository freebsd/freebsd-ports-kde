CONSED installation directory: %%PREFIX%%/share/consed

  You must do either of following (see section 4.5 of README.txt):
  1) set CONSED_HOME environment variable to the location above
  2) make /usr/local/genome be a symlink targeting to the location above

Example files are installed not as world writable, which README.txt assumes.
So you must copy the files to anywhere you have writable permissions.

Now you can follow README.txt from section 4.12
