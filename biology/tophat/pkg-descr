TopHat is a fast splice junction mapper for RNA-Seq reads. It aligns RNA-Seq
reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra high-throughput short read
aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the mapping results to identify splice
junctions between exons.

Note:

TopHat has been Superseded by HISAT2 and is no longer maintained upstream.
This port is provided mainly for revisiting old studies where TopHat was used.
