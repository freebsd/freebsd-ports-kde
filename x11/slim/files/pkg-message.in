Thanks to Nikos Ntarmos, it is now possible to start slim from /etc/ttys.
Please see %%PREFIX%%/etc/rc.d/slim for instructions on how to do that.

Alternatively, just put

slim_enable=yes

into /etc/rc.conf

*** Option "sessions" is no longer supported. ***

Now you need to put session files in the directory specified by option
"sessiondir". They should be xdg-style .desktop files.
The "Name" entry in the session file would be used as session name.
The "Exec" entry would replace %session in login_cmd.
