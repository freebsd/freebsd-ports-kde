There is a native (faster) file watching support backed by kqueue which is
enabled by default.  If you encounter problems with watching large
trees, you can disable it by appending the following property into
%%DATADIR%%/bin/idea.properties:

      idea.filewatcher.disabled=true

Only enable fsnotifier if your projects have < 600 files.

At systems which use links for /usr/home/user or /home/user apparently
IDEA finds two different VCS roots while trying to integrate with Git.
Please, use as a VCS root only one of them.
