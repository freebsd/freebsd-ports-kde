The nsysctl utility is a sysctl(8) clone to get or set the
kernel state supporting libxo and extra options, features:

 * new options to show the properties of a state,
 * output is explicitly indicated by the options,
 * the options are not mutually exclusive,
 * output via libxo in human and machine readable formats,
 * some value is parsed to show structured output.
