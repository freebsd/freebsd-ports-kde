BSDploy is a comprehensive tool to provision, configure and maintain
FreeBSD jail hosts and jails.

Its main design goal is to lower the barrier to repeatable jail setups.

  * Modular provisioning with plugins for VirtualBox, Amazon EC2 and
    an achitecture to support more.
  * Bootstrap complete jail hosts from scratch.
  * Declarative configuration: All hosts and their properties defined
    in ploy.conf are automatically exposed to Ansible.
  * Imperative maintenance: Run Fabric scripts with ploy do JAILNAME
    TASKNAME and have all of the hosts and their variables in fab.env.
  * Configure ZFS pools and filesystems with whole-disk-encryption.
