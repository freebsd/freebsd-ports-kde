======================================================================

Please see %%ETCDIR%% for sample versions of graylog.conf, log4j.xml, and
and adjust them for your configuration.

For GeoIP support you need to install the net/GeoIP port and
configure the path to the GeoIP databases in the Graylog Web Interface.

When running graylog in a jail, you need to set enforce_statfs for the jail.

For a single-node installation, install:

- databases/mongodb36
- textproc/elasticsearch5

And ensure that the elasticsearch cluster name matches that used by graylog.

The locations for configuration files have changed to match upstream
versions in 3.0 of this port, refer to UPDATING for migration steps.
