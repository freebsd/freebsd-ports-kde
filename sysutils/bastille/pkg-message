**Breaking changes since 0.14.20250420**

The `rcorder` has been deprecated, and new `boot` and `priority` options have
been added to the jails. A boot file will be created with default values of
`boot=on` and `priority=99` on jail creation. For existing jails, the boot file
will be generated on the next subcommand execution to the jail. If you want to
generate the file for all the jails, you can use `bastille restart ALL` to fill
in the defaults. To change these values, use `bastille config TARGET set boot off`
or `bastille config TARGET set priority 10` or some other number according to
your needs.
