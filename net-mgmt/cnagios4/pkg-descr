Cnagios is a full-screen terminal interface for viewing Nagios HOST
and SERVICE objects, and the durations of their current states.  It's 
lightning fast because it's written in C using the curses library.
And it's super flexible because it uses the perl C library to shorten 
and alter host, service and plugin output and filter the displayed 
HOSTs or SERVICEs.
