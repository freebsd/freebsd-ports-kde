Please note that NetBox requires a PostgreSQL database server, which uses its
built-in network address datatypes. Thus NetBox won't work with other RDBMS's,
e.g. MySQL, MariaDB, etc.

For installation instructions please refer to the related wiki page:

# python%%PYTHON_VER%% manage.py collectstatic --no-input

2. Restart WSGI/httpd environment (supervisord/apache/nginx/etc.)
